# TinyUI
TinyUI is a small library to create buttons and input fields to .NET console applications

## How to use the library

Create empty .NET console project, clone this repository to the project folder. 

```git clone https://github.com/VtotheK/TinyUI```

Let's create a class that will hold the code  UI logic and funtion declarations for the buttons.

```cs
HelloWorldWindow window = new HelloWorldWindow();
```

Let's create a method inside MyNewWindowClass that will hold the inputfield and button declarations, as well as button press logic.
We will call this method CreateUI
```cs
public void CreateUI()
```
